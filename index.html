      <h2>Red Paper Clip Project</h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="blogPost">
        <h3>1st Update 9/21/2021</h3>
        <p>
          I have to do the "Red Paperclip" project for school and make blog posts about it so here is the rundown:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>1) Start with a red paperclip</li>
          <li>2) Barter your way to (hopefully) better things</li>
          <li>3) End up with something (again hopefully) better than a red paperclip</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>

        <p>
          Ideally I might be able to get something of a little more value but the man 
          that popularized this trend got a house so that is what I'm shooting for. 
          Realistically though I will probably only end up with like a phone charger or 
          something of similar value.
          <br><br>
          I will probably mostly stay at school and in my neighborhood but I might explore
          the slimy depths of facebook marketplace if I feel bold enough to. I will try to
          only trade with people who have something of higher value than I, but that most
          likely will fall through at some point or another.
          <br><br>
          Anyways on to the actual trade I did:
          <br><br>
          The first trade I did this week was I traded the paperclip to my dad for a 
          piece of paper. While this might not seem like a great trade I can use the piece
          of paper and fold it which is an easy way to create value. I will try my best to 
          keep doing this as it could help boost along my trading adventure.
          <br><br>
          Anywho I then folded the piece of paper into a little dragon which then allowed
          me to trade it for an old amazon box that my mother didn't need anymore. Again,
          I used my skills to make it into a little cardboard airplane which is where I 
          am at now.
          <br><br>
          <img src="./Assets/plane.jpg" alt="plane">
          <br><br>
          I feel like I am in a decent position, and I have already made a lot of progress
          from the paper clip i started out with.
